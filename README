MIDI-Morph

The aim of MIDI::Morph is to provide an easy-to-use composition tool that allows
transitions between two 'gestalten' (musical snippets). The data handled by
this module is in MIDI::Score format (at this moment, only note events
are considered).

This is an alpha release, features and API will be extended and changed
iteratively.
